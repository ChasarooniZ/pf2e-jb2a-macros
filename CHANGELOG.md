# Version 2.6.3
- Literally nothing

# Version 2.6.2
- With Sequencer 2.3.18, Advanced Macros v1.19.1 is now available. Both Sequencer's and Advanced Macros' minimum versions were raised to newest. Advanced Macros maximum version has been removed.
- Removed Compendium Folders entries in favour of PF2e's integrated compendium search function.
- Updated Equipment Changes and Aeon Stone macros to not use deprecated data paths.
- Updated localization files.

# Version 2.6.1 "Whackamole"

  - The MAXIMUM version of Advanced Macros is now 1.18.1 in module.json.

# Version 2.6.0
- Fixed bug in Equipment Changes macro due to a recent Advanced Macros update. The minimum version for Advanced Macros is now 1.19.1.

- Summoning spells and Manifest Eidolon animations can now be customized down to the creature you are summoning.
  - You can see examples in "Summoning Animation Template" action in PF2e Animation Actions compendium.
  - Note that this update has been released before Automated Animations "Await Animation Completion" setting for macros has been released. As such, your creatures will appear instantly, and then the summoning animation will commence.

# Version 2.5.4

- Improved the styling of the Autorecognition Update Menu a little.

- Added localization files and submitted them to Weblate.

# Version 2.2.3

- Improved the Autorecognition Update Menu and fixed a major bug.

- Fixed bug in Autorecognition Update Menu where it "updated" entries that contained the same name (ex. Fang, Magic Fang, Fangs === Fang).

# Version 2.1.0
- Added the Autorecognition Update Menu, available in Settings. It is from now on your go-to way to update PF2e animations in Automated Animations.
- Fixed and perhaps added a bunch of effects. Unfortunately the list of them is lost to time spent on the above.

# Version 2.0.0
- Renamed from "PF2e x JB2A Macros Compendium" to "PF2e Animation Macros".
- Updated autorec for Automated Animations Version 4.
  - **THIS MEANS IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF AUTOMATED ANIMATIONS, LET ALONE FOUNDRY.**
  - This also means no onlyNewStuff autorec file due to this massive change in how autorecs are generated. The file will also likely no longer exist in the future, in favour of an automated process in the module itself.
- Removed Token Borders macro in favour of AA animations.
- Added automatic Guidance Immunity on removal of Guidance effect.
- Added a pop-up to add the Rage effect when you use the Rage action. Can be set to automatically accept in the module settings.

# Version 1.12.1
- Added `await` when getting a local macro for an animation.

- Added Ki Rush spell.
- Fixed Abundant Spell.
- Removed Stances and Animal Instinct effects, and Unarmed Strikes macro. No longer necessary with updates to the system.

### Known Issues
- The player may not be able to Dismiss creatures they summoned. They can remedy that by turning "Dismiss button scope" Warp Gate setting to "All owned tokens". Note that this also makes them able to dismiss themselves!
- When summoning certain creatures, they have floating text deducting their HP.
- When summoning more than one creature, they spawn on top of each other. See this [issue](https://github.com/trioderegion/warpgate/issues/77).
- When summoning anything that isn't Medium, they scale from Medium to their size instead of spawning in proper size from the beginning.
 - This also causes larger creatures to have a "missing hitbox", only allowing their upper left corner to be selected. This can be fixed on a map refresh.
- Due to lack of PDF to Foundry module in V10, it has not been tested whether the summons include the token images it creates. There is a chance they don't.

- Updated all macros with the following:
  - Compatible with Sequencer 2.2.0 and beyond

  - A setting to disable it is provided, regardless of it existing in the Autorecognition Menu or not.

- Added Marshal's Aura

# Version 1.8.0 - Equipment!
- Added CHANGELOG.md
- Switched Sneak Attack to active an Automated Animations entry than a macro.
- Added an "Equipment Changes" macro that triggers every time the itemUpdate hook is triggered. This allows to create "On Equip" and "On Invest" animations.
  - On that note, Aeon Stones animations have been added. Invest a stone to have it floating around your token.
- Finished "Bardic Cantripry" macro, at least with the most common composition cantrips out there.
- Fixed "Dimension Jumps" macro to actually use the level of the spell being cast than the player's maximum spell level.
  - This also marks the addition of the `pf2eJB2AMacros` flag, right now used to mark the level of the spell in a more accessible way.

# Version 1.7.8
- Fixed an error happening with the lack of a fire animation in Persistent Conditions macro. (thanks @ Michael_B)
  - (There is still no animation as the default is the token being on fire already, and there's no "fire bursts" animations outside of fireball; This fix is just so there are no errors popping up and exit gracefully.)

# Version 1.7.7
- Fixed a bug relating to "Use Local Macros" setting. (Thanks @ Micheal_B)

# Version 1.7.6 a.k.a. "Just Push so There's Something" Edition
- Added Sneak Attack and Persistent Damage macros which do not use AA but an in-house method to detect when to be played.
  - This peculiarity also means that in order to have users be able to modify those animations without the module deleting their efforts upon an update, a new setting has been added, causing the module to instead play macros from your **World** than the **Compendium**.

  __Note that this applies to ALL macros using this method, so you'll need both Persistent Conditions AND Sneak Attack macros imported to your world for them to properly work with this setting, even if only one of them is modified.__
  - Persistent Damage animations require the [PF2E Persistent Damage](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-persistent-damage) module.
- Added plenty of condition animations.
- Added Various Teleportation animations to most if not all spells which teleport the player.
- Fixed #5 Rage Particle Animations are Patreon-only.
- Fixed an issue with Heal and Harm spells having invalid damaging animations.
- Added Guidance Immunity.

# Version 1.7.4
- Fixed Import Pop-Ups appearing on Player's Side

# Version 1.7.3
- Added sound effects to Produce Flame.
- Fixed zIndex'es on Rage's ground cracks.
- Changed Raise a Shield animation to use a macro from the PF2e Action Macros compendium rather one imported into a game.
- Added Bouncing Lightning animation, which is used for both Chain Lightning and Electric Arc.

# Version 1.7.2
- Added Rage Active Effect animation.

# Version 1.7.1

# Version 1.7.0 - No More Imports! (Mostly)
- Removed Importing of Macros and Items.
  - Macros are now being called through the compendium (REQUIRES Sequencer v2.1.0+)
  - Items can be added through usual Compendiums, but are no longer automatically added to the game by the importer.
  - Actors still get imported as they have to be for the Dancing Lights cantrip.
- Revamped Heal and Harm macros to post the amount they heal when using the 2-Action version.

# Version 1.6.1
- Fixed the Actions compendium not showing up.

# Version 1.6.0
- Added [PF2e Ranged Combat](https://github.com/JDCalvert/FVTT-PF2e-Ranged-Combat) reload actions to the module Compendiums.
- Added sounds to Bow, Crossbow, and Firearm animations.
- Added Eagle Eye Elixir + some other mutagens or bombs.
- Removed a lot of Firearm animations in favor of one generic Firearm animation. Some firearms animations remain as their functions were distinct enough to warrant a different animation.

# Version 1.5.0
- Added Bane and Bless Animations.

# Version 1.4.0
- Removed the modified copy of PF2e Workbench's Magic Missile macro, as the original now has animations.

# Version 1.3.0
- Added Alchemist's Fire, Acid Flask, Acid Splash, Peshpine Grenade, Frost Vial, and Drakeheart Mutagen animations.

# Version 1.2.0
- Fixed ability-made AE animations, such as Guidance, Dueling Parry, etc. activating when the ability itself was put into chat rather than added as an AE by renaming the Active Effects to contain the "Effect" prefix.
  - tl;dr This fixes double-animations when you post an ability to chat and add the AE by the same name to a token.
